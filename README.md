# 161215_RunRandom_Week8_JavaAndroid_Project

Run Random - A run tracker and challenge randomiser app for week 8 project at CodeClan.

Project Brief

Objective

The project is an opportunity to practice OO and UI design with what you have learned in the Java / Android weeks.
It is also an opportunity to research into SQLite databases to persist data.


MVP

You are required to write an Android app that allows a user to track the their runs.
Users should be able to enter their run, date, distance, time and a comment.


Extensions

The app should show the user a record of what they have ran over a given period e.g. March you ran a total of 100km.
Add a run randomiser to allow users to have a run type generated for them.
They can add this run challenge to their run log.
Accepting challenges gains the user points.
Rejecting challenges loses the user points.
